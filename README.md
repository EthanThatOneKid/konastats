> Homepage for Mr. Pines' website.

## About 🤔

Mr. Pines was a math teacher and sports coach at my high school.
While in his class, I was annoyed at how basic his home website looked so I offered to redesign it for him.
This repository is the result of that offer and now it exists on [his domain, konastats.com](http://konastats.com/).
[Here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/EthanThatOneKid/konastats/blob/master/index.html) is a back-up link in case his site shuts down some day.
Enjoy, Mr. Pines' students; my successors.

## How Its Made 🛠

I created the design of this site using [Material Design](https://material.io/design/) conventions.
Everything else is done with pure HTML and some custom CSS.
