# Konastats.com
Homepage for Mr. Pines' website.

## About
Mr. Pines has a website where you can find all of the homework for all of the classes he teaches.
A preview of the website can be found [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/EthanThatOneKid/konastats/blob/master/index.html) and the actual website can be found [here](http://konastats.com/). Enjoy, classmates.
Also, concerning Mr. Pines, check out this other project of mine, [Cribbage Calc](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/EthanThatOneKid/math/blob/master/cribbage/demo/index.html). It helps you solve those pesky cribbage warm-up questions.

## How
I am using Google Material Design to help style the webpage. Everything else is done with pure html and css. Check the console for a surprise, btw.
